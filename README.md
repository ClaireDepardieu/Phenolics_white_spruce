Phenolics_white_spruce is a repository for data related to the manuscript entitled "Combining QTL mapping and transcriptomics to decipher the genetic architecture of phenolic compounds metabolism in the conifer white spruce" published in Frontiers in Plant Science (2021) by Justine Laoué, Claire Depardieu, Sébastien Gérardi, Manuel Lamothe, Claude Bomal, Aida Azaiez, Marie-Claude Gros-Louis, Brian Boyle, Almuth Hammerbacher, Nathalie Isabel, and Jean Bousquet.  

Raw data files: (1) The file GCAT_WS_3.3.cluseq.fa is a fasta file including assembled, as reported by Philippe Rigault (for details see Rigault et al., 2011) (2) The file Concentration_metabolites.xlsx is an excel file reporting values of phenolic content (in (mg g-1 dry weight))for astringin, catechin, gallocatechin, isorhapontin, neolignan-2 (4-[1,3-dihydroxy-2-[2-hydroxy-4-(3-hydroxypropyl)phenoxy]propyl]- β-D-xylopyranoside), piceid, procyanidin B1, taxifolin and taxifolin glucoside.
